                        What if you weren’t born?  What if you were made?

                        Made for a purpose.

                        <br/>
                        In the streets of Aeonston, there are two types of people.  Those you can’t trust and those who are only out for themselves.
                        <br/>
                        And when you’re a vat-born genetic chimera – a true lab rat – on a mission to capture the breath of a dragon, knowing who to trust is everything.  But when everything about you is artificial, can you even trust yourself?
